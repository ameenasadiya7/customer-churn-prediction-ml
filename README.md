Customer Churn Prediction – Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts whether a customer is likely to leave a service using machine learning techniques based on historical customer data.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)  
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Train-test split  
- Logistic Regression model  
- Model evaluation using accuracy  

## Result
- Achieved approximately **82% accuracy** in predicting customer churn.

## What the Model Does (Simple Explanation)
The model learns patterns from past customer behavior (such as service usage and subscription details) and predicts whether a customer is likely to leave the service. This helps businesses identify high-risk customers early and take retention actions.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**
2. Upload the dataset (`WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`)
3. Run all cells sequentially

## Use Case
Helps businesses identify high-risk customers early and take proactive, data-driven retention strategies.
